Cafe management System(reserving tables ) is developed using Circular Queue in C.
ABSTRACT
•	In this digital world where everything happens by a click of mouse, reserving tables through software is important as it is beneficial for both administrator as well as customer.
•	 The objective of this program is to implement a reserving table in restaurant using data structure concept. It is a menu driven program through which we can reserve tables in a restaurant and generate the detailed statistics of number of customers per day. 
•	Reserving tables in restaurant can also be implemented as pre booking, it is also important as it avoids customer waiting if all tables are filled and administrator can also make sure to take count on total number of customers reserving tables in restaurant at the end of the day. This program can also be implemented as backend in customer booking portal.
•	The objective is accomplished by implementing Circular Queue.
•	The various functionalities such as booking table, deleting the token number of   reserved seats, displaying status of the tables (number of tables available, token number issued) and saving total number of customers who entered restaurant in file.
•	The tables are booked into two, four, six-seater tables. Hence, customer can book the tables of respective seater tables.
•	 This project can be used by:	
          Online user - For booking by customer
          Administrator – Management  
DATA STRUCTURE USED:
The data structure used in this project is circular queue.
Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle.
The last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called Ring Buffer.
In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full. But once queue becomes full, we can not insert the next element even if there is a space in front of queue.
Whereas in circular Queue  elements can be inserted even if there is space in front of queue
